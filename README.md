# Greek-Texter

A small python program that converts text and applies some greek characters to make the text look cool i guess.

### Can run in console but i recommend compiling with PyInstaller or downloading the release (Windows/macOS)

## Warning macOS .app is compiled on Apple M1 <sup>(Apple Silicon)</sup> and will _NOT_ work on Intel!
