# Greek-Texter

A small python program that converts text and applies some greek characters to make the text look cool i guess.

Can run in console but i recommend compiling with PyInstaller or downloading the release (Windows/macOS)
## Warning macOS .app is compiled on Apple M1 (Apple Silicon) and will not work on Intel!
## As for Linux and Macs on Intel, you have to compile yourself or use python in terminal to run bare files
